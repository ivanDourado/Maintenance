# 🛠️ Maintenance Dashboard

This project presents a Power BI dashboard built to analyze and monitor **maintenance operations** based on structured data provided in `BaseDados.xlsx`.

## 📁 Data Source

- `BaseDados.xlsx`: Contains records related to maintenance requests, equipment status, completion dates, downtime, responsible teams, and maintenance types (e.g., preventive, corrective).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track maintenance request volume over time  
- Identify trends in equipment failures  
- Monitor resolution times and delays  
- Evaluate team performance and workload  
- Optimize the scheduling of preventive maintenance

## 📊 Key Metrics

- 🔧 **Total Maintenance Requests**  
- 🕒 **Average Resolution Time**  
- 📉 **Downtime per Equipment**  
- 🟢 **Preventive vs Corrective Ratio**  
- 👥 **Requests by Team or Technician**  
- ⏳ **Requests Overdue**

## 📌 Dashboard Features

- Filters by period, equipment, status, maintenance type, and team  
- Monthly trend analysis with comparison to previous periods  
- Bar and line charts to visualize volume and delays  
- Pie charts to show request distribution  
- Dynamic KPIs for instant insights

## 🧠 Insights Extracted

- Certain equipment types have **recurring failures**, indicating potential structural issues or improper usage.  
- The majority of overdue requests are concentrated in **corrective maintenance**, suggesting a need to reinforce preventive strategies.  
- **Team A** resolved the highest number of requests with the **shortest average resolution time**, standing out in performance evaluations.  
- **Monday and Friday** show peak request openings, which can inform staffing and support shifts.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling and dashboard design  
- **Excel**: Source data organization  
- **DAX**: Calculated columns and KPIs
